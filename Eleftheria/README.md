# EDA 
Notebook where I run Exploratory data analysis on the data and also pre-processed the text. 
# Logistic Regression, MLPClassifier, MultinomialNB, SVM
Run the Logistic Regression classifier for both Count Vectorization and TFIDF Vectorization, without tuning the parameters of the classifier. 
However run an analysis on the different test set size and the number of folds of cross valiation

*P.S. : I kept these text representation techniques and these classifiers because these seem to give the best results
Next up : Play with the parameters. I'll do that by keeping the best combination of test set size and cross validation folds that resulted in the previous analysis.*
